# PotterNetwork
NetworkX graph analysis for a dataset containing all the relationships between the characters of the Harry Potter saga.

The Harry Potter saga is an amazing story which involves a big number of characters who have different relations to each other. 
We found an interesting project in GitHub where four great developers gathered data of each character of the saga and added the relations between them, 
which have been divided in friendship relationships (+ symbol between two nodes) and hate relationships (- symbol). 
We decided to start from these two datasets and implement our own graph analysis using NetworkX.
